# Virtual-Acoustics---4-artificial-reverbs

In this project we developed 4 artificial reverbs.
We used different platforms and languages to achieve this goal

Further information can be found in each folder of the repository

The reverbs include:

1. Lexicon inspired reverb for the Daisy seed platform in C++
2. Chris Moor inspired FDN in MAX/MSP
3. Colorless Differentiabel Feedback Delay Network in Faust
4. Luff
