# Virtual-Acoustics---4-artificial-reverbs

In this project we developed 4 artificial reverbs.
We used different platforms and languages to achieve this goal

Further information can be found in each folder of the repository

The reverbs include:

1. Chris Moor inspired FDN in MAX/MSP
2. Colorless Differentiabel Feedback Delay Network in Faust
3. Hybrid reverb with FDN and convolution in Juice
4. Lexicon inspired reverb for the Daisy seed platform in C++
